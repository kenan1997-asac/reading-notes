Colors are specified using predefined color names, or RGB, HEX, HSL, RGBA, HSLA values.You can specify your choice of background color in the same three ways you can specify foreground colors: RGB values, hex codes, and color names.HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness - and represents a cylindrical-coordinate representation of colors.
Values for red, green, and blue are expressed as numbers between 0 and 255. Hex values represent values for red, green, and blue in hexadecimal code. Colors are represented by predefined names. However, they are very limited in number.
