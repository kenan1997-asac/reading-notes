Windows is just a graphical user interface to linux, Instead you can use terminal which is a text based interface to the system. Where you issue commands and take outputs from there. Inside the terminal shell or (bash) will define the behavior of the terminal. And to make the use of linux easier, shortcuts are used.

By issuing the command PWD on the terminal it will give you your current destination your working on, which makes it a good reminder in advanced work.
Now, after locating your current destination you can list the directories by using the command LS.

To specify a location we use paths, and there are two ways to specify a path or a location by using absolute path which uses (/) at the beginning or by just using relative paths. Cd is the shortcut used to move between directories and it’s an abbreviation for change directories.

Dealing with linux is different than dealing with the GUI where it treats everything as a file even for the I/O devices such as your keyboard or just your speakers. In addition to that it’s also an extensionless system it doesn’t care about file extensions but still it can distinguish between them.
