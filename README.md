## This repo is about Growth Mindset

Hello there! *I'm Eng.Kenan Al-Talahmeh*, a tech enthusiastic. Currently I'm a software development intern at _**ASAC**_.

So as the description suggests this repo will discuss _**Mindsets**_ especailly the __Growth mindsets__.

To stat we must define what is a Mindset? a Mind  set is the mentality of handling a certain task or a way of thing regarding a plan, or achiving a goal. 
clearly everyone have a diffrent mindset and a way of making things done. there is people who think that every thing is limited and can't be enhanced or developed by training which leads to failure at most of the times.

On the other hand, there are another type of people who belives that nothing is limited and that the sky is the limit. which makes them have a higher rate of success atleast at the end. 

so it's a good start by breaking mindset into two types. starting with the stationary or best described as fixed mindset, defined earlier. moreover, the second type of mindset is the dynamic mindsets also best described as the growth mindset which we all look to have.

to achive a Growth mindset, I personally work on three main aspects :

1. *Patience* 
2. *Improving my skills* 
3. *Maintaining a healthy lifestyle*
