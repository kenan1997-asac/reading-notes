we usually add *div* to seperate like elements together. now lets talk about the *header* were we can put the name & the logo of our website, also we add the *nav* inside the header were we put the links of all the main features of the webpage. On the otherhand, we add the *footer* to the webpage were all the copyrights, the links to terms and conditions.

*Article* tags are used to specify a self-contained content, usually to they are used to add blog posts and News stories.with the help of *Aside* tags we can add information related to the article we used insidde the *Article* tag. also, wwhen the *Aside* tag is used outside the *Aricle* tags it's usually used to add links related to subject of the page.
