### Headings 

There are 6 levels of heading sizes, starting from *<h1>* which is used for main headings and has not only the biggest font size but also the highest priority. we then move on to *<h2>* which is usually used for subheadings, and so on until we reach *<h6>*.

in addition to the size,  the heading tags give the browsers the ability to reach the site easier, since it displays the contents of the headings at different sizes.

### Paragraphs

Creating paragraphs has never been simpler, you can creat a paraghraph by simply opening a *<P>* tag and start writing what ever text yoou want to add and then closing it by *</P>*.

### Bold and Italic

bold and itslics are also simple to be used, to change any text to bold just enclosing the text in the tags *<B>* and *</B>*. The same thing applies for italic but instead the *<I>* *</I>* are used.

### Sup/Sub Scripts

You can add a Sup/Sub scripts by opening a *<sup>* or *<sub>* before the text and close it with a closing tag *</sup>*,*</sub>* respectively.

### Stong

as the name suggests this tag is used to show importace of a certain text.

## Chapter 10

CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside a box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.


Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.


CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,although they may appear within an HTML page.

a variable is a changeable element or simply think of it as a box that can carry anything stored in it. it's declared by the intial *var*.
