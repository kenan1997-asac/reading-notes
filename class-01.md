Windows is just a graphical user interface to linux, Instead you can use terminal which is a text based interface to the system. Where you issue commands and take outputs from there. Inside the terminal shell or (bash) will define the behavior of the terminal. And to make the use of linux easier, shortcuts are used.

By issuing the command PWD on the terminal it will give you your current destination your working on, which makes it a good reminder in advanced work.
Now, after locating your current destination you can list the directories by using the command LS.

To specify a location we use paths, and there are two ways to specify a path or a location by using absolute path which uses (/) at the beginning or by just using relative paths. Cd is the shortcut used to move between directories and it’s an abbreviation for change directories.

Dealing with linux is different than dealing with the GUI where it treats everything as a file even for the I/O devices such as your keyboard or just your speakers. In addition to that it’s also an extensionless system it doesn’t care about file extensions but still it can distinguish between them.

Markdown is a way of styling using non letter symbols, you can make text bold or for example make it italic using * and _ , in addition to that you can use markdown to add images or links  . Github also uses  markdown to create tables, references, task lists, emojis, and much more. 

We can use CSS to add an image background using *background-image* to set one or more images as a background for an html page. it's placed at the top-left corner of the page and it's then repeated both horizontally & vertically. 

we usually add *div* to seperate like elements together. now lets talk about the *header* were we can put the name & the logo of our website, also we add the *nav* inside the header were we put the links of all the main features of the webpage. On the otherhand, we add the *footer* to the webpage were all the copyrights, the links to terms and conditions.

*Article* tags are used to specify a self-contained content, usually to they are used to add blog posts and News stories.with the help of *Aside* tags we can add information related to the article we used insidde the *Article* tag. also, wwhen the *Aside* tag is used outside the *Aricle* tags it's usually used to add links related to subject of the page.

it's worth mentioning that the *Figure* tags are also used to specify a sel-contained content, but this time we're talking about digrams, and photos.

*Arrays* are used to store more than one value in a single variable. you can think of an Array as a special variable, which can store multiple values at a time. 

it's mainly used in loops which are executed many times, were regular way of storing variables is panic.

you can creat an array using the *var* tag followed by the array name. in example var array_name = [item1, item2, ...];, were *item* is the name of the variable you want to store in.

Colors are specified using predefined color names, or RGB, HEX, HSL, RGBA, HSLA values.You can specify your choice of background color in the same three ways you can specify foreground colors: RGB values, hex codes, and color names.HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness - and represents a cylindrical-coordinate representation of colors.
Values for red, green, and blue are expressed as numbers between 0 and 255. Hex values represent values for red, green, and blue in hexadecimal code. Colors are represented by predefined names. However, they are very limited in number.
