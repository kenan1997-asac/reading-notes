## Comparison commands

As many other operators in programing, there is commparison operators. in which they compare two operands usually using a single operator. this operator could be comparing the one of the following:

 1. *Value*
 - if they are equal (==)
 - if one operand is greater/smaller than or equal ( >/< || >= / <= )
 - if they are NOT equal (!=)
 2. if they are in the same *format type* and value (===)

## Loops (For & while)

A loop is simply defined as a function that is run for a specefic number or just unknown times. There are two main types of loops:

1. *For* loop
- which is executed for a specific number of times. all the loop parameters are contained inside the loop parentheses. you can specify or know the number of runs from there.
2. *While* loop
- which is executed for a unspecified number of times. and the parameters are initialized outside the parentheses, only the conditition is put inside the while parentheses.

both of them run until the condition stated is not met.
